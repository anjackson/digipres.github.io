# About this site

The goal is to help the members of the international digital preservation community to find each other, to grow, and to find ways to support each other. Crucially, we want to help pool our knowledge and resources so we can do more and better preservation, and try to avoid anyone re-inventing the wheel. Of course, this ethos also extends to this gateway site, so please <a href="https://github.com/digipres/digipres.github.io/issues">raise any issues (e.g. what have we missed?)</a>, <a href="https://github.com/digipres/digipres.github.io">contribute to this web site</a>, or <a href="https://github.com/orgs/digipres/discussions">discuss your ideas with us</a>.

## Scope

The primary goal is to be a portal to other resources, and not to reproduce things that already exist and are openly accessible.

But there are some things we think we need that didn't already exist somewhere else, and the DigiPres.org site and GitHub account act as a home for those too. This includes, for example, the _Format Index_.

There are also specific topics that require some introduction and are not well suited to terse format of the Awesome List.  This site provides a way to host suitable articles in a simple way. These articles can be used to point out particularly important resources and refer to the relevant sections of the Awesome List for more pointers. Again, the goal is to pull together existing resources rather than supplant them.
